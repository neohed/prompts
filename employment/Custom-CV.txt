I am applying for the {JOB_TITLE} position at
{COMPANY_NAME}. I would like you to rewrite my CV to
make it as relevant as possible to this specific job.

Please prioritize the following keywords from the job
description, if provided:
* {KEYWORD_1}
* {KEYWORD_2}

Additionally, identify and incorporate other relevant
keywords from the job description to ensure my CV aligns
closely with the role.

To optimize my CV for ATS systems:
* Look for role-specific terms in the job description and
emphasize them in my CV, especially if they appear multiple
times.
* Use industry-specific terminologies, but ensure it doesn't
look like I've copied the job description verbatim.
* Ensure the CV is ATS-friendly in terms of format and
content.

Please also use the same language as the job description
throughout my CV.

I am including the full JD below:
